# About Atomic Frenzy

# About

I'm Stuart Rogers — a self-taught hardware and firmware developer with over a decade of experience building embedded systems, custom PCBs, and fully integrated embedded designs.

## Early Curiosity, Real-World Growth

My journey started young, experimenting with Linux systems and growing increasingly curious about how computers worked. A high school computer science class sparked my interest in programming, and I dove into Java throughout my teen years. While I eventually moved away from software development, that early foundation shaped how I approach embedded design today: with structure, logic, and a deep respect for the stack.

In 2013, while working retail at Target, I rekindled my passion for electronics. I taught myself to solder, probe circuits with a multimeter, and interpret signals on an oscilloscope. My first builds used an Arduino Uno interfaced with C# desktop apps — a stepping stone that quickly evolved into hand-designed analog and digital circuits. I’ve since worked with STM32, EFM8, ESP32, AVR, and PIC platforms, always pushing for designs that feel polished, robust, and intentional.

## Embedded Systems, IT, and Infrastructure

Later that year, a local trade school owner gave me an opportunity to design real hardware. That led to a sponsored role at Mid City College, where I developed an NFC-based access control system — evolving from a basic Arduino sketch into a full embedded platform with networked backend, C# configuration utility, and MySQL database. I also managed the college’s IT infrastructure: pfSense routing, VoIP systems, virtual machines, and direct student tech support. It was a formative experience in systems thinking, bridging embedded, backend, and user-facing interfaces.

In 2016, I briefly joined Occam Vision Group in Boulder, Colorado. There, I assembled high-speed computer vision systems, operated a pick-and-place machine, reflowed boards, calibrated five-camera arrays, and supported prototype EFM8 firmware bring-up — reinforcing my appreciation for disciplined hardware workflows and production constraints.

## Atomic Frenzy

After the trade school closed in 2019, I shifted my focus toward self-employment. In 2020, during the early stages of the pandemic, I returned to Vermont and launched a small eBay business selling multimeter OLED displays. These began as refinements of open-source community designs, but quickly evolved into original products—each one a combination of simulation, custom PCB design, and practical engineering.

My products include:

- A custom logic probe tuned through analog simulation and VNA analysis  
- A programmable HVAC interval timer powered by the ESP32  
- Tools built with precision in mind, assembled in small runs using my own pick-and-place machine

I design schematics in Altium, model enclosures in SolidWorks, and prototype using my own fleet of 3D printers (four FDM and one SLA). I ship tested, working tools that I personally design, build, and support.

## Featured Project: XVA_TouchStack

Among my most ambitious projects is the **XVA_TouchStack** — a hardware interface for FPGA-based synthesizers (XVA1 and XFM2). It combines audio out, CV in, MIDI I/O, USB UART, capacitive touch, power sequencing, and FPGA integration. The firmware supports real-time CV modulation, preset recall, and FPGA state reading.

I later developed a Pi 5-based variant running a Windows 7 QEMU VM for FPGA programming, alongside a local LLaMA 1B model. This allowed natural-language synth queries, audio classification, and a full retrieval pipeline from generated sounds. It’s an unusual but powerful integration of embedded control, edge AI, and retrocompatibility — built entirely from scratch.

## Life Transitions and Independent Work

In 2020, during the early stages of the pandemic, I returned to Vermont and began shifting my focus toward self-directed technical work. I launched a small eBay business selling multimeter OLED displays—initially based on open-source community designs from the EEVBlog forums. These soon evolved into original products, including a logic probe requiring detailed analog simulation and VNA tuning. Each design reflects my hands-on, iterative workflow: schematic capture in Altium Designer, enclosure modeling in SolidWorks, small-batch production using desktop manufacturing tools, and continuous field testing.

## Looking Ahead

I'm continuing to build and document projects under the Atomic Frenzy label while exploring remote opportunities in embedded systems, edge AI, and full-stack hardware development. I'm especially interested in technologies like the ESP32, STM32, and AI-capable platforms such as the NDP101.

Outside of engineering, I’ve developed a growing interest in Chinese language and culture. I’ve considered spending time in Taiwan—either for extended travel or as a remote base of operations. While I’m not looking to change fields, I see language learning and international experience as valuable complements to a flexible, sustainable technical career.

My long-term goal is to continue developing useful tools, collaborating with others in the embedded space, and building a path that combines autonomy, curiosity, and real-world engineering.

# Atomic Frenzy

I'm Stuart Rogers, a self-taught hardware and firmware developer with over a decade of experience designing real-world embedded systems, custom PCBs, and networked devices. From concept to deployment, I specialize in solving complex problems at the intersection of hardware and softwareâ€”crafting tools, instruments, and prototypes that are both practical and precise.

Atomic Frenzy is my independent design labâ€”a place where ideas are built, tested, and shipped. Whether you're here to learn more about my work, explore custom electronics, or connect over a shared passion for embedded tech, you're in the right place.

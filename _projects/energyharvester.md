This project represents one of my early designs, completed in March 2015. Utilizing the Texas Instruments BQ2557 energy harvesting IC, the circuit enabled efficient battery charging from a single solar cell. The initial concept was to develop a device for environmental monitoring, but the scope ultimately exceeded available budget and resources.

While most documentation for this project has been lost, one image remainsâ€”a custom light fixture incorporating the module. The energy harvester can be seen in the lower right corner, with the solar cell positioned behind several diffusing layers.

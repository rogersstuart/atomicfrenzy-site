Over the years, my engineering journey has led me through a variety of projectsâ€”one of which was the development of a replacement controller for a maple syrup evaporator. This opportunity arose during August of 2022 while attending an engineering class, where I met a local community member in need of a reliable solution for his equipment.

I reverse engineered the original board and designed a new controller, selecting higher-quality components and implementing robust thermal protection.

Photos of the original board that I reverse engineered.

Below is a video demonstration of the controller in operation:

The schematic for the controller is shown below. For this project, I experimented with custom-drawn symbols, resulting in a distinctive appearance. Despite their unconventional look, the circuit functions reliably.

A 3D render of the board is also provided. While not a fully detailed representation, it illustrates the essential design features of the controller.
